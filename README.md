Technological improvements make human beings more tied to high-tech devices. As the time passes, these devices started 
to integrate in each other, beginning a multi-functional device era. People liked the technological growth but they wanted 
more. As a result, this trend led to the fact of “mobile devices”. Recent observations show that a regular person owns at 
least one mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet. The increasing demand for mobile devices make the developers 
extend the usage area of the mobile devices and let them act like a small computer. Nowadays, it is possible to read books,
order food, access and modify information on the internet in addition to the standard services, such as phoning and 
messaging.  The capabilities of the mobile devices are really high and therefore, there are a wide range of applications 
for a wide range of interests.

New features are not always good. Sometimes they confuse their users and allow them do things in a wrong or unwanted way. 
This situation marks an important point, the design issue. The way that the mobile application and the user interacts is 
still a hot research topic among these days. However, it is easily observed that the applications which people do research 
on these topics are not so good looking, which makes research work more time consuming and difficult. In general, the 
start point of a research should be a library and due to the recent trends, a mobile application for a library should be 
well designed and highly usable for a successful research.
